 <h3>November Rain (feat. Julien P & Kathy Huang) (Lofi Remix) </h3>
 <p>A great mix of an old classic with a trendy touch.</p>

 <h3>Darkmoon (2021 Version) (그믐달 (2021 Version))</h3>
 <p>Highkey sad as fuck but nostalgia's crazy. Late night uni vibes.</p>
 
 <h3>Zavon - Giannis (Produced by Miler)</h3>
 <p>Insane piece. The fact that it barely has views makes it 22 times better.
    Pure embodiment of a "dobin type song.
